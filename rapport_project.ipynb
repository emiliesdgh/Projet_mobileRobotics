    "As part of the Basics of Mobile Robotic class given by M. Mondada, we are asked to implement a project using the Thymio robot. This project involves the robot reaching a goal while moving in an environment filled with permanent obstacles. During it's path, some extra physical obstacles can be placed in its way. In such moments, the Thymio has to be able to avoid them and continue its route to the end point.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is then done using several concepts seen in class such as image processing and pattern detection with Computer Vision, the Motion Control using a controller, Global and Local Navigation of the Thymio and Filtering.\n",

    "2. **Find the best path :** The obective is that the Thymio goes from an *arbitrary point* in the map to a *target* that can be placed <u>anywhere</u> in the environment.  These will be changed during the demo to see how the system performs.\n",
